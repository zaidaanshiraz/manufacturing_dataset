Manufacturing Equipment Output PredictionThis project contains a Streamlit web application that predicts manufacturing equipment output based on various machine parameters. The prediction is made using a Linear Regression model trained on a sample manufacturing dataset.The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.Project Structure.

Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.8+Docker (for containerized deployment)1. Running the Application LocallyA. Clone the repository or download the files.B. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
C. Run the Streamlit application:Ensure that app.py and manufacturing_dataset_1000_samples.csv are in the same directory.streamlit run app.py
The application will start, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.2. Building and Running with DockerA. Build the Docker image:Open your terminal in the project's root directory (where the Dockerfile is located) and run the following command:docker build -t manufacturing-prediction-app .
B. Run the Docker container:Once the image is built, you can run it as a container:docker run -p 8501:8501 manufacturing-prediction-app
This command maps port 8501 from the container to port 8501 on your local machine.C. Access the application:Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to use the application running inside the Docker container.How It WorksModel Training: If a pre-trained model (linear_regression_model.pkl) is not found, the app.py script will first train a simple Linear Regression model using the data from manufacturing_dataset_1000_samples.csv. The trained model is then saved as a pickle file.User Interface: The Streamlit interface provides sliders and input fields in the sidebar for you to enter the machine's operating parameters.Prediction: When you click the "Predict Output" button, the application takes the input parameters, feeds them into the loaded model, and displays the predicted hourly output.
